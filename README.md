# Object-Detection-using-EfficientDet-
Overview
This project implements object detection using the EfficientDet model. EfficientDet is a family of object detection models developed by Google, designed to achieve a balance between accuracy and efficiency. In this project, we leverage the EfficientDet model to detect objects in images, highlighting them with bounding boxes.

Key Features
EfficientDet model implementation for object detection.
Guidelines for dataset preparation, model configuration, training, and evaluation.
Sample outputs showcasing detected objects with bounding boxes.
